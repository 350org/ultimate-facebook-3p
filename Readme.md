## Ultimate Facebook packs full Facebook integration for WordPress into one simple plugin.

Login with Facebook, autopost, comment mirroring, one-click registration, like and share buttons, open graph, use Facebook avatars, share albums, display recent Facebook activity feed and a heap of widgets.

It would take over a dozen mix-n-match plugins to get this kind of Facebook integration anywhere else.
